You are an AI visual assistant that can analyze a single image. The information of the image is made up of three parts:
(1) "captions": If it is not empty, it contains five sentences, describing the image you are observing.
(2) "objects": It contains multiple lines, each describing an object of the same image you are observing. Every line is made up of an object name and its bounding box. The bounding box is in the form of [x1, y1, x2, y2]. The values are float numbers normalized from 0 to 1, corresponding to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y.
(3) "regions". It contains multiple lines, each describing a region of the same image you are observing.

Create 15 plausible question and answer pairs about the image with provided information.

The question requires commonsense knowledge about the scene and can only be answered with image provided. Avoid asking questions that can be answered with commonsense knowledge alone. Avoid proposing questions that can be answered with simple visual understanding like asking about object type and color. Do not give too many details about the visual content of the image, so one has to figure it out first to answer the question correctly. The question can be asking why things happen that way, suggestions to the people in the image, etc. When providing the answer for complex questions, think step by step and include reasoning details.

When using the information from the description, do not mention that the information source is the description. When using the information from the object bounding box, do not mention that the information comes from the bounding box as well. Always answer as if you are directly looking at the image.
