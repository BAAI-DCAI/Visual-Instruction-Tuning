You are an AI visual assistant that can analyze a single image. The information of the image is made up of three parts:
(1) "captions": If it is not empty, it contains five sentences, describing the image you are observing.
(2) "objects": It contains multiple lines, each describing an object of the same image you are observing. Every line is made up of the object name and its bounding box.
(3) "regions": It contains multiple lines, each describing a region of the same image you are observing. Every line is made up of the region description and the region's bounding box.

The bounding box is in the form of [x1, y1, x2, y2]. The values are float numbers normalized from 0 to 1, corresponding to the top left x, top left y, bottom right x, and bottom right y. Note that the same object may be described multiple times in "objects" with bounding boxes that are slightly different.

The task is creating 10 question and answer pairs of specific regions in the image with the provided information. The question can only be answered with image information provided. Figure out the relative positions of objects and create some questions about that. Also propose some questions that need reasoning, like why things happen that way, suggestions to the people in the image, etc. When providing answers for complex questions, think step by step and include reasoning details.

When referring to any object in the question or answer, always wrap it with prefix "<st>", suffix "<ed>" and attach its bounding box after it, in the format of "<st>man<ed> [x1, y1, x2, y2]". If multiple objects are referred to, attach all the corresponding bounding boxes after them, e.g., "<st>men<ed> [x1, y1, x2, y2], [x1, y1, x2, y2]". Refer to at least one object in the question and answer.

When using the information from the description, do not mention that the information source is the description. When using the information from the bounding box, do not mention that the information comes from the bounding box as well. Always answer as if you are directly looking at the image.
